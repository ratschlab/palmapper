Beta Release 0.4 (DD MONTH, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release introduces a lot of changes since the last version and
fixes a few bugs. The documentation of PALMapper is now available in
PDF format under the subdirectory doc/. Please, consult the
documentation for more information about how to use this software.

Notable changes in palmapper output:
 * Fixed bugs which may lead to incorrect cigar string or incorrect
 exon length in SAM file
 * Add more informative tags in SAM output: ZS, Xe, Xi, XI, XN, HI,
 AS, XQ, XD, Xd. Consult the documentation for more information
 * Give strand flag only for splice reads
 * Fixed bug for minimal exon length in Bedx output

Notable changes in palmapper options:
 * add -no-ss-pred option to compute alignments without using splice site predictions
 * add -acc-consensus and -don-consensus options to define splice site 
 consensus sequences to consider (options have to be jointly used with
 -no-ss-pred)
 * Add -non-consensus-search option (search for a spliced alignment
 with non consensus splice sites which does not overlap with a spliced
 alignment with known consensus splice sites)
 * 

Other notable changes:
 * Multithreading
 * Allow seed lengths up to 15 for array-based indexes
 * Genome coverage computation (-report-coverage-wig option)
 * Add fast mapping with bwt-based index (Burrows-Wheeler
 Transform). We use the sources from BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Alignment
 tool) which are located under src/bwa. The use of bwt-based index
 should give the same results than with the use of the array-based
 index provided by GenomeMapper.

Beta Release Candidate 0.4-rc3 (09 May, 2010)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notable changes in palmapper:
 * Improve rtrim and polytrim strategies
 * Set SAM as default output format for mapped reads
 * Set /dev/null as default output file for unmapped reads
 * Merge unspliced and spliced alignments in the same output if -H
 option not given
 * Save space by using smaller index (don't generate index for negative strand)
