Setting default parameters:
* Automatically determining alignment parameters based on read length (75nt): -K 15 -L 20 -C 37 -NI 2 -E 6 -M 6 -G 2
* Automatically determined minimal segment length in spliced alignments based on read length (8nt)
* Automatically determined maximal intron size based on genome size (20kb)
