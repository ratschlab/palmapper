Computational splice site predictions are available at:

ftp://ftp.tuebingen.mpg.de/pub/fml/raetsch-lab/predictions/splice/

These splice site predictions have to be used together with the genome
version that is provided with the splice site predictions.  The
sequences and their order in the fasta file have to be correct for a
successful application of Palmapper.
