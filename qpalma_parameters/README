This folder contains pretrained QPALMA parameter files for use with Palmapper.
The naming convention is as follows:

<organism>_<library-name>_l<read-length>.qpalma for single end sequencing, and
<organism>_<library-name>_<left|right>_l<read-length>.qpalma for paired end sequencing

To obtain new parameter settings, use the QPALMA release available at http://www.fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/qpalma
or the galaxy web server at http://galaxy.fml.mpg.de/ -> QPALMA tools.
