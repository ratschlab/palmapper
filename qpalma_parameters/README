This folder contains pretrained QPALMA parameter files for use with Palmapper.
There are two subdirectories:

* no_splice_pred for parameter files obtained by training QPALMA
without splice site predictions. The naming convention is as follows:

		<organism>_<library-name>_l<read-length>_no-ss-pred.qpalma for single end sequencing, and
		<organism>_<library-name>_<left|right>_l<read-length>.qpalma for paired end sequencing.

* splice_pred for parameter files obtained by training QPALMA
with splice site predictions. The naming convention is as follows:

	 <organism>_<library-name>_l<read-length>.qpalma for single end sequencing, and
	 <organism>_<library-name>_<left|right>_l<read-length>.qpalma for paired end sequencing.


To obtain new parameter settings, use the QPALMA release available at http://www.fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/qpalma
or the galaxy web server at http://galaxy.fml.mpg.de/ -> QPALMA tools.
