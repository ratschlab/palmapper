Installation
------------

On most platforms it is sufficient to run

make

Depending on the compiler, the compiler flags need to be adapted in Makefile.  
To get a list of command line options, use

./pmindex
or
./palmapper  

Testing
-------

To test whether palmapper produces expected results, use

cd ./testcase
make test

Additional Contents
-------------------

The directory ./qpalma_parameters contains parameter settings for
spliced alignments with Palmapper (see ./qpalma_parameters/README for
more details).

The directory ./splice_predictions contains instructions on how to
obtain precomputed splice site predictions for a growing list of
organisms (see ./splice_predictions/README for more details). To
obtain predictions use:

cd splice_predictions
make <organism-name>
